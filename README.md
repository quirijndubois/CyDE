# CyDE

The official web IDE for working on [CyPress](https://github.com/quirijndubois/cypress) projects. 

Still in early development. Not yet functional with [CyPress](https://github.com/quirijndubois/cypress) or [CyPDF](https://github.com/pieterteb/CyPDF)

Try [here](https://quirijndubois.github.io/CyDE/public). 

To actually work with files, run the api locally by cloning the repo and running:
```bash
pip install fastpi 
fastapi dev API/main.py
```
Then click the link above.
